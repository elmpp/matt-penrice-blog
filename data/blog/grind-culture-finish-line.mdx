The indie developer world is [littered](https://kitze.io/posts/saddest-just-ship-it-story-ever) with tales of builders who never get their projects over the release line, often seeing more seemingly inferior ones step up and get traction. Very recently for me, this has happened for the second time and it absolutely sucks. And we're not talking small prototype SAAS products here but real multiyear [sunken-cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) territory.

But this isn't a post about the importance of iteration and end-user feedback. This is a promise to myself.

I'm 43 and for the past 8 years I have been pouring almost every spare moment into the startup dream. Recently, I have found that this brings 2 main realisations; the first, of course, is that time is increasingly limited and valuable. The second is that for whatever reason, you're on a certain track in life and that it may not be the best for you. After sitting with this second one for a while, i'm ok with doing what has to be done with getting off, and I'm writing this to put a marker in the ground

In the spirit of [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), I'm setting myself the goal of launching 6 projects in 12 months. After that, if I'm not where I want to be, I'm done

## Why This Feels Like The Right Thing For Me

The same so-called virtues of [grind culture](https://medium.com/@lewisibdp/grind-culture-e2aa2b84ab5c) such as drive and persistence just appear as joyless pursuit and tunnel vision on studied reflection. I'm hoping the finite durations will keep me from going too head-down. I see this personality aspect as both a blessing and a curse. [John McCarmack puts it very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIvHkaV6Ri8)

In work, [I've always only been a consultant](/blog/a-life-of-consulting). One side effect of this is that it breeds an inclination to believe that software can be made in a vacuum. Thankfully, I realise that this very much is not the case and it's a living thing, as much a driver of peoples' requirements as a result of them (coincidentally, I now see the parallels with [innovation in general](/books/innovation)). So, I will welcome as much feedback as I can get whilst I learn to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) through this process

I'm aiming for 6 startups because I'll be selecting more technically-challenging projects. This is my "moat" against the indie dev masses. My aspiration, anyway, has always been for sustainable businesses leaning toward B2B.

## What's Next

I'll update the [projects](/projects/) page at a steady bimonthly cadence from now on. Presently, I have 2 runnable ideas; the first a semi-continuation from my latest ~fail~ discovery-of-a-non-workable-solution.

Onwards!
